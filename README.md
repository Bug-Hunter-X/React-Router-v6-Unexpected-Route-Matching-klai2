# React Router v6 Unexpected Route Matching Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using React Router v6: unexpected route matching or navigation problems.  The problem involves routes not matching as expected, leading to incorrect page rendering or navigation failures.

## Problem Description

The `bug.js` file contains a React application using `react-router-dom` v6. Under certain conditions (e.g., specific navigation or path parameter combinations), the routes may not match as intended, resulting in unexpected behavior.  This could be due to issues with nested routes, path parameters, or incorrect route order.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the application addressing the unexpected route matching problem. The solution focuses on ensuring correct path definitions, proper handling of path parameters, and resolving any conflicts in route prioritization.  The specific fix will depend on the root cause identified in the `bug.js` file, but it may include adjusting path patterns, using more precise matching strategies, or reordering the routes within the `Routes` component.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
